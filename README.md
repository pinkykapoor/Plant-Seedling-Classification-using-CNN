# Plant Seedling Classification using CNN

## Project Overview
This project aims to use deep learning to classify plant seedlings. It's part of an initiative to modernize agriculture using AI and Deep Learning, reducing manual labor in plant sorting and recognition.


## Objective:
The aim of this project is to use a deep learning model to classify plant seedlings through supervised learning.

## Data Description:
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species at several growth stages.

You are provided with a dataset of images of plant seedlings at various stages of growth.

- Each image has a filename that is its unique id.
- The dataset comprises 12 plant species.
- The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.

### List of Species

- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet

****Learning Outcomes****
 
- Pre-processing of image data
- Visualization of images
- Building the CNN
- Evaluating the Model
