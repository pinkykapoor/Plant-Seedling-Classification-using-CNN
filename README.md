# Plant Seedling Classification using CNN

## Context:
In recent times, the field of agriculture has been in urgent need of modernizing, since the amount of manual work people need to put in to check if plants are growing correctly is still highly extensive. Despite several advances in agricultural technology, people working in the agricultural industry still need to have the ability to sort and recognize different plants and weeds, which takes a lot of time and effort in the long term. The potential is ripe for this trillion-dollar industry to be greatly impacted by technological innovations that cut down on the requirement for manual labor, and this is where Artificial Intelligence can actually benefit the workers in this field, as the time and energy required to identify plant seedlings will be greatly shortened by the use of AI and Deep Learning. The ability to do so far more efficiently and even more effectively than experienced manual labor, could lead to better crop yields, the freeing up of human inolvement for higher-order agricultural decision making, and in the long term will result in more sustainable environmental practices in agriculture as well.

## Objective:
The aim of this project is to use a deep learning model to classify plant seedlings through supervised learning.

## Data Description:
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with the University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 different species at several growth stages.

You are provided with a dataset of images of plant seedlings at various stages of growth.

- Each image has a filename that is its unique id.
- The dataset comprises 12 plant species.
- The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo.

### List of Species

- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common Wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet

**** Learning Outcomes:
 
- Pre-processing of image data
- Visualization of images
- Building the CNN
- Evaluating the Model
